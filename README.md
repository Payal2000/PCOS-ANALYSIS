 PCOS-ANALYSIS

- In undertaking this project, I embarked on an in-depth exploration of PCOS and PCOD. 
- This endeavor was both an academic pursuit and a personal reflection, having experienced the challenges of PCOS firsthand for over five years.
- Recognizing that menstrual health, particularly conditions like PCOS, often remains under-discussed in many societies, this project was my attempt to foster a broader understanding. 
- By intertwining evidence-based findings with personal narratives, I hope to promote a more informed and empathetic dialogue around this significant health concern.
